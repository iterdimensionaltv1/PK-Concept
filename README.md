# üèÜ Penalty King - Interactive Video Soccer Game Concept

Penalty King is an interactive, browser-based soccer game experience built around a cinematic penalty kick shootout. The game utilizes pre-rendered video assets (MP4s) to create a dynamic, choice-driven narrative. Players select a superstar character (currently featuring Ronaldo or Messi), take penalty shots, and witness unique outcomes based on their decisions and randomized game events.

This project serves as a proof-of-concept for creating interactive video experiences using standard web technologies.

## ‚ú® Core Features

  * **Interactive Video Gameplay:** Core gameplay revolves around making choices at key moments, which trigger different video segments.
  * **Character Selection:** Players can choose between iconic soccer superstars (currently implemented: Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi).
  * **Player-Specific Sequences:** The game features unique video paths for the selected character, including tunnel walkouts, name screens, penalty setups, and reactions.
  * **Dynamic Branching Narrative:** Player choices (e.g., shot direction) combined with randomized elements (e.g., goalkeeper's dive) lead to various outcomes (goal or save).
  * **Modular Video Structure:** The game logic is designed to work with a library of distinct video clips for different game events and cinematic moments.
  * **Web-Based:** Runs directly in any modern web browser.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

  * **HTML5:** For the basic page structure and the `<video>` element.
  * **CSS3:** For styling the game interface, video player, and interactive hotspots.
  * **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** For all game logic, video control, event handling, hotspot management, and dynamic content updates.

## üöÄ Setup and Running the Game

1.  **Get the Code:**

      * Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/iterdimensionaltv1/PK-Concept.git`
      * Or download the project files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).

2.  **Populate Video Assets (Very Important\!):**

      * Create a folder named `videos` in the root of the project directory (alongside `index.html`).
      * **You must provide your own MP4 video files.** These files need to be named *exactly* as specified in the `src` attributes within the `videoData` object in `script.js`.
      * A list of required MP4 filenames can be generated by inspecting the `videoData` object in `script.js`. (The AI assistant previously provided a list of these filenames).

3.  **Add Audio File:**

      * Create an `audio` folder in the project root (alongside `videos`).
      * Place your character select music loop as `character_select_loop.mp3` inside this folder.
      * This file will play in a loop during the character selection screens.

4.  **Open in Browser:**

      * Navigate to the project folder in your file explorer.
      * Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

5.  **Play:**

      * Click the "Play" button to start the game.
      * Follow on-screen prompts and click interactive hotspots to progress.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works

The game's engine is driven by JavaScript:

  * **`videoData` Object (`script.js`):** This is the heart of the game's structure. It's a JavaScript object that defines:

      * Each video segment with a unique key.
      * The `src` path to the corresponding MP4 file.
      * A `poster` image URL (placeholder shown while video loads).
      * `hotspots`: An array defining interactive areas for that video, including:
          * `shape` (rectangle or circle), position (`x, y, width, height` or `cx, cy, r`).
          * `startTime` and `endTime` for when the hotspot is active.
          * `targetVideo`: The key of the next video or a special logic string (e.g., `LOGIC_HANDLE_SHOT`) to trigger upon clicking.
          * Custom properties (e.g., `character`, `shotDirection`) to pass data for logic handlers.
      * `onEnd`: The key of the video to play automatically when the current video finishes.
      * `isLogicHop`: A flag for special keys that trigger JavaScript functions instead of playing a video directly (e.g., for game state checks).

  * **JavaScript Logic (`script.js`):**

      * **Video Control:** Manages loading, playing, pausing, and tracking events of the HTML5 video player.
      * **Event Listeners:**
          * `ended`: Triggers loading of the next video defined in `onEnd` or game logic.
          * `timeupdate`: Regularly checks the current video time to show/hide relevant hotspots.
          * `click` (on hotspots and buttons): Handles user interactions.
      * **Hotspot Management:** Dynamically creates, positions, and manages HTML `<div>` elements as clickable hotspots overlayed on the video.
      * **Game State:** Manages variables like the selected character (`gameState.selectedCharacterName`), score, and kicks taken.
      * **Logic Functions:**
          * `confirmCharacter()`: Sets the chosen character and loads their specific introductory sequence.
          * `handleShotChoice()`: Determines the outcome of a penalty kick based on player input and randomized keeper action, then loads the corresponding player-specific outcome video.
          * `LOGIC_CHECK_GAME_STATE`: A placeholder for more complex logic to determine if the game continues, transitions to a win/loss state, etc.

## üéûÔ∏è Video Asset List

The game requires a significant number of MP4 video files to function as designed. All required filenames are defined as `src` properties within the `videoData` object in `script.js`. Ensure every video file listed there exists in the `videos/` directory with the exact same name.

Key video sequences include:

  * Initial stadium flythrough.
  * Character selection idles (Ronaldo, Messi on the pitch).
  * Player-specific tunnel walkouts and name screens.
  * Player-specific penalty setup animations.
  * 9 unique shot vs. keeper outcome animations *for each player* (e.g., shot left vs keeper dives right - goal/save).
  * Player-specific goal celebrations and save/miss reactions.
  * Generic crowd reactions.
  * Transitions (e.g., scoreboard updates).
  * Player-specific win/loss sequences.
  * Generic game over / restart screen.

## üé® Customization & Further Development

This project is a foundation. Here are some ways it can be expanded:

  * **Full Video Asset Integration:** Create and integrate all the defined MP4 files.
  * **Refine Timings & Hotspots:** Adjust `startTime`, `endTime`, and coordinates for all hotspots in `videoData` to perfectly match your video content.
  * **Complex Game Logic:**
      * Implement a proper scoring system for both player and an (AI) opponent.
      * Develop sophisticated win/loss/draw conditions.
      * Add more states to `LOGIC_CHECK_GAME_STATE`.
  * **Expand Character Roster:** Add more characters, each with their own set of specific videos.
  * **Enhanced UI/UX:** Improve the visual design of hotspots, buttons, and messages.
  * **Sound Design:** Add background music, sound effects for kicks, crowd noises, etc. (Note: Autoplay with sound can be restricted by browsers).
  * **Performance Optimization:** For a large number of videos, consider strategies for preloading or more advanced asset management.
